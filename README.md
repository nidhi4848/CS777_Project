### Flight Data Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes flight data using PySpark, focusing on preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and clustering. The goal is to uncover insights into flight pricing and booking patterns, predict fare prices, and identify meaningful customer segments.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices).

## Files
- **CS777_nidhird_project_report.pdf**: The final project report.
- **Flight Price Analysis Using PySpark.pdf**: The final PowerPoint presentation.
- **driver output.txt**: Contains the results from the analysis.
- **nidhird_project.py**: The Python file with the PySpark code.
- **flight_prices_small.csv.bz2**: Is the small dataset
